# sensor_test

This project is for testing environmental sensors (e.g., AHT20, ENS160) with the ESP32 platform. It is set up for PlatformIO and includes:

- Example code for reading temperature, humidity, and air quality
- PlatformIO configuration files
- Modular component structure

## Getting Started
1. Open this folder in PlatformIO/VS Code.
2. Connect your ESP32 board and sensors.
3. Build and upload the project.

## Folder Structure
